## Features

- **Whitespace Removal:** Automatically crops the image to remove any unnecessary whitespace.
- **Edge Detection:** Highlights the edges of images to improve the accuracy of template matching.
- **Slide Positioning:** Accurately finds and marks the position of the puzzle piece within the background image.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/vsmutok/Puzzle-Captcha-Solver.git
   cd Puzzle-Captcha-Solver
   ```
2. Create and activate virtual environment:
   ```sh
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```


## Usage

The primary class in this project is `PuzzleCaptchaSolver`. Here's how you can use it:

1. **Initialization:** Create an instance of `PuzzleCaptchaSolver` by providing the paths to the gap image, background image, and the output image path.

2. **Discern:** Call the `discern` method to process the images and find the position of the slide.

### Example

```python
from PuzzleCaptchaSolver import PuzzleCaptchaSolver

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solver = PuzzleCaptchaSolver(
        gap_image_path="demo/geetest4/1_slice.png",
        bg_image_path="demo/geetest4/1_bg.png",
        output_image_path="demo/geetest4/1_result.png"
    )
    position = solver.discern()
    print(f"The position of the slide is: {position}")
```

**Input Images**:
- Background Image
> ![Background Image](demo/geetest4/1_bg.png)
- Slide Image
>![Slide Image](demo/geetest4/1_slice.png)

**Output Image**:
> ![Result Image](demo/geetest4/1_result.png)

In the resulting image, the detected position of the sliding piece is highlighted with a red rectangle.


### Methods

- `remove_whitespace(image)`: Removes whitespace from an image.
- `apply_edge_detection(img)`: Applies edge detection on the given image.
- `find_position_of_slide(slide_pic, background_pic)`: Finds the position of the slide on the background picture.
- `discern()`: Performs the full discernment process to find the position of the slide in the given images.
